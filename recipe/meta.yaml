  summary: The fast cross-validation via sequential testing (CVST) procedure is an improved cross-validation
    procedure which uses non-parametric testing coupled with sequential analysis to
    determine the best parameter set on linearly increasing subsets of the data. By
    eliminating under-performing candidates quickly and keeping promising candidates
    as long as possible, the method speeds up the computation while preserving the capability
    of a full cross-validation. Additionally to the CVST the package contains an implementation
    of the ordinary k-fold cross-validation with a flexible and powerful set of helper
    objects and methods to handle the overall model selection process. The implementations
    of the Cochran's Q test with permutations and the sequential testing framework of
    Wald are generic and can therefore also be used in other contexts.
